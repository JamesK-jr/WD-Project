  <p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Hallow's Haunt is a yearly tradition for me and my family!  Their Haunted House is extremely spooky, and the Hedge Maze is no joke (once got lost for an hour in there).</p>
  <p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">One of the scareist haunted houses I have been to in a long time.  If you're looking for a scare, this is your best bet!</p>
  <p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">A great Halloween event for the whole family! Most of the event wont scare kids too bad, just stay out of the haunted house if you don't want to get spooked!</p>
  <p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">I'm really not a fan of being scared but all of the events around the haunted house make it more than worth the entry price.  A great place to bring your friends and family if you're looking for something to do to celebrate Halloween!</p>
